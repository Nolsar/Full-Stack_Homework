--FILES EXPLAINED--
CONFIG
MIDDLEWARE
isAuthenticated.js { 
restricts routes that a user is not allowed to visit if not logged in. if user is logged in, it continues with request };

config.json { connection configuration to connect to server };
passport.js { contains javascript logic that tells passport we want to log in with an email address and password };
MODELS
index.js { connects to database and imports users log in data };
user.js { requires "bcrypt" for password hashing. This makes our database secure even if compromised. Here we have JS that defines what is stored on our database };
ROUTES
api-routes.js { contains routes for signing in, logging out and getting users specific data to be displayed client side };
html-routes.js { routes that check whether user is signed in, whether user already has account etc and sends them to the correct html page };
package.json { contains all package info, node modules used, version info etc };
server.js { requires packages, sets up PORT, creates express and middleware, creates routes and syncs database / logs message in terminal on successful connection to server };
